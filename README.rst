Educational Aims and Objectives of the Course
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable the students to:

-  Understand the nature of remote sensing data and how they are
   acquired
-  Understand different types of remote sensing instruments and their
   missions
-  Understand basic image representation and processing
-  Understand how Earth Observation data can be combined with other
   sources of data and data techniques (e.g. GIS)
-  Understand how EO data can be used in environmental science
   (particularly via classification and monitoring)
-  Develop practical skills in these areas, which may be useful in
   planning of dissertations
-  Develop links with the second year course on Geographic Information
   Systems Science and with othet courses as appropriate
   (e.g. hydrology, environmental systems)

Monday lectures are in are in NWW G07 and Thursday practical sessions
will be in North West Wing Room 110 (‘Unix lab’)

ENVI Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ENVI is available on the machines in NWW 110, though there are othe
roptions for independent learning.

ENVI 5.5.3 is available to registered students through Virtual UCL PCs
during the live sessions via UCL Desktop Anywhere (see help info at
https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/how-to/how-to-log-to-virtual-teaching-pc).

For ad-hoc use of ENVI software outside of the live hours, it can be
accessed from UCL Desktop Anywhere. We will use the ENVI 5.5.3 (not ENVI
Classic 5.5.3) version for the guided practicals before half term.
Additionally, you can install ENVI on your personal computer with a UCL
license (http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/view/id/142?filter=envi).
However, support might be limited from the teaching staff. Thus, we
recommend using Desktop@UCL during the term time for best support and
accessibility.

Google Earth Engine is accessed from within IPython notebook. These can
be easily run on `UCL jupyter
hub <https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/>`__, accessible using a
standard UCL login. The notebooks can also be used wthin a open-source
conda distribution, though setting up all the libraries can be
cumbersome and staff will not have the time to support this.
