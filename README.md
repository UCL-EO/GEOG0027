-----------------------------------


#### <a name="Education">Educational Aims and Objectives of the Course</a>

 To enable the students to: 
 
+ Understand the nature of remote sensing data and how they are acquired
+ Understand different types of remote sensing instruments and their missions
+ Understand basic image representation and processing
+ Understand how Earth Observation data can be combined with other sources of data and data techniques (e.g. GIS)
+ Understand how EO data can be used in environmental science (particularly via classification and monitoring)
+ Develop practical skills in these areas, which may be useful in planning of dissertations
+ Develop links with the second year course on Geographic Information Systems Science and with othet courses as appropriate (e.g. hydrology, environmental systems)

Lectures for this module are pre-recorded and all computing sessions are available through MS Teams on Monday 9:00-10:00. You will also need to access a Virtual UCL PC during the live sessions through UCL Desktop Anywhere (see help info at https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/how-to/how-to-log-to-virtual-teaching-pc). There will be optional drop-in help sessions run by PGTA every Monday and Thursday 10:00-11:00 through the same MS Teams channel. 

#### ENVI Software
ENVI 5.5.3 will be available to registered students through Virtual UCL PCs during the live sessions via UCL Desktop Anywhere (see help info at https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/how-to/how-to-log-to-virtual-teaching-pc). 

For ad-hoc use of ENVI software outside of the live hours, it can be accessed from UCL Desktop Anywhere. We will use the ENVI 5.5.3  (not ENVI Classic 5.5.3) version for the guided practicals before half term, and then ENVI 5.5.3 with IDL for the assessed coursework project. Additionally, you can install ENVI on your personal computer with a UCL license (http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/view/id/142?filter=envi). However, support might be limited from the teaching staff. Thus, we recommend using Desktop@UCL during the term time for best support and accessibility.
