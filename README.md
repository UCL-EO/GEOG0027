-----------------------------------


#### <a name="education">Educational Aims and Objectives of the Course</a>

 To enable the students to: 
 
+ Understand the nature of remote sensing data and how they are acquired
+ Understand different types of remote sensing instruments and their missions
+ Understand basic image representation and processing
+ Understand how Earth Observation data can be combined with other sources of data and data techniques (e.g. GIS)
+ Understand how EO data can be used in environmental science (particularly via classification and monitoring)
+ Develop practical skills in these areas, which may be useful in planning of dissertations
+ Develop links with the second year course on Geographic Information Systems Science and with othet courses as appropriate (e.g. hydrology, environmental systems)

Tuesday lectures are in Bedford Way (20) - Room: A5.02 and Thursday practical sessions will be in the North West Wing Room 110 ('Unix lab')

#### ENVI Software
ENVI 6.0 is available on the machines in NWW 110.

Google Earth Engine is accessed from within IPython notebook. These can be easily run on [UCL jupyter hub](https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/), accessible using a standard UCL login. The notebooks can also be used wthin a open-source conda distribution, though setting up all the libraries can be cumbersome and staff will not have the time to support this.
